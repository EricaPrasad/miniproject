        <p style="text-align: center;">The average human body contains about five liters of blood, which is made of several cellular
          and non-cellular components such as <strong>Red blood cell</strong>, 
           <strong>Platelet</strong>, and <strong>Plasma</strong>.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Each type of component has its unique properties and can be used for different
                                         indications. The donated blood is separated into these components
                                         by the blood centre and one donated unit can save upto four lives depending on the number of
                                          components separated from your blood.</p>
        <!-- <p style="text-align: center;">For <strong>plasma</strong> and <strong>platelet</strong> donation you must
          have donated whole blood in past two years.</p> -->

            Blood Collected straight from the donor into a blood bag and mixed with an anticoagulant is
  called as whole blood. This collected whole blood is then centrifuged and red cell, platelets and
  plasma are separated. The separated Red cells are mixed with a preservative to be called as
  packed red blood cells.</p>
  
          <h3>Who can donate?</h3>
  
          <p>You need to be 18-65 years old, weight 45kg or more and be fit and healthy.</p>

            The straw-coloured liquid in which red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets float in is called plasma.Contains
            special nutrients which can be used to create 18 different type of medical products to treat many
            different medical conditions. Plasma can be obtained from the collected whole blood after red blood cells and platelets have
            been separated. Additionally, it can also be collected using an apheresis equipment where other
            components are returned to the donor. The former is a common method of plasma preparation in
            our country.</p>
  
          <h3>Who can donate?</h3>
  
          <p>The donation criteria is similar to that of red blood cell. However, for apheresis plasma
            collection minimum weight is 50 kgs.</p>

            These are cellular elements in blood which wedge together to help to clot and reduce bleeding. Always in high
            demand, Vital for people with low platelet count, like hematology and cancer patients.</p>
  
          <h3>Who can donate?</h3>
  
          <p>One can donate whole blood from which the blood centre will separate platelets from other
  components. Criteria similar to whole blood donation apply.
  Alternatively, one can donate using apheresis equipment where only platelets are collected and
  rest components are returned back to donate. One need to satisfy whole blood criteria and pre-
  donation screening which include negative infectious markers and platelet count &gt;1,50,000 per
  microlitre of blood. Weight should be &gt;50kgs.</p>
